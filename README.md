## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is created to **practice C programming daily** and develop **strong logical thinking**.  
I regularly add **C language problems** covering **all types of concepts**, including basics, logic building, memory handling, and real-world problem scenarios.

Each **part contains exactly 100 problems** no more, no less.  
Problems inside a part are **mixed**, meaning every part helps improve **overall C programming skills**, not just a single topic.

> 💡 *Consistency is the key — solving problems daily makes logic sharper and coding stronger.*
